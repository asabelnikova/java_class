Rome wasn't build in one day
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill
Once bitten, twice shy
Nothing ventured , nothing gain
Actions speak lounder than words
One man's meat is another man's poison
Engage brain before mouth
Let's cross that bridge when we come to it
If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys
Why have a dog and bsrk yourself
Horses for courses
If you fly with the crows, you will get shot with the crows
